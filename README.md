## **The end of the field challenge**

a live result can be seen [HERE](https://becodeorg.github.io/verou-4-the-fiield-challenge-kenosama/)

## **First exercice**

for the first exercice, i used the interface 9 from the simple exercice.

**Technologies used:**

 - HTML
 - SCSS
 
Why? because i like the nesting of Scss and allows to set variables easily of needed. (and the watcher gives me straight away the error on which line i made the mistake :) )

I used a font from google but it is not the right one, i really bad a finding fonts :/ 



## Second exercice


For the second one i went for the complex one, interface 9. 
(*who said i was masochist ????*), a bit of challenge doesn't hurt and if i'm not going out of my confort zone i wont progress.

technologies used:
HTML
SCSS
For the same reason, possibility to update he color variables to change straight away an load of items at the same time.
I used a grid system here splited in 12 columns for responsivity purposes. it allows me to set the span of the menu items easily (span 2). 
Used https://fontawesome.com/ icons for design.
